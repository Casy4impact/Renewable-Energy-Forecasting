This project aims to develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict the energy output of a wind turbine system based on weather conditions observed one hour prior. Accurate forecasting of wind energy supports optimal energy grid planning, cost-effective resource management, and sustainable development goals.

## Project Background
Wind energy, a cornerstone of renewable power, is highly variable due to its dependence on weather conditions. To manage this variability, energy producers need robust models that can accurately predict energy output based on recent meteorological data. This project applies machine learning techniques to address this challenge, using historical weather and energy generation data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of time-series observations recorded hourly. Each row represents weather conditions and the corresponding energy output from a wind turbine. Key features include:
- •	Temperature
- •	Humidity
- •	Wind Speed
- •	Wind Direction
- •	Air Pressure
- •	Timestamp
- •	Energy Output (Target variable)
The dataset is clean and well-structured, making it suitable for predictive modeling tasks.

## Project Workflow
1.	Data Collection
Historical data was sourced from a reliable renewable energy dataset repository. The dataset contains weather and energy measurements recorded at hourly intervals.

3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data. Key observations include:
- o	Wind speed had the strongest correlation with energy output.
- o	Energy output showed clear daily and seasonal patterns.
- o	Minor fluctuations in temperature and humidity also impacted power generation.
  
3.	Feature Engineering
To enhance model performance, several time-based features were engineered from the timestamp index:
- o	Quarter: Indicates which quarter (Q1–Q4) the data point falls in.
- o	Month: Extracted to analyze seasonal effects on energy generation.
- o	Week Number: Helps track week-level patterns in energy production.
- o	Hour: Used to uncover intraday trends in energy yield.
- o	Season: A new feature was created by mapping each month to a season:
  - Spring: March to May
  -	Summer: June to August
	- Fall: September to November
	- Winter: December to February
    
This set of derived features provided additional context and temporal insight, which improved model learning and accuracy.

4.	Data Preprocessing
- o	Datetime formatting: Ensured the timestamp column was converted to a proper datetime index.
- o	Feature scaling: Standardized numerical features where required.
- o	Categorical encoding: Encoded the season feature for compatibility with ML models.
- o	Train-test split: The dataset was split into training and testing subsets to evaluate generalization performance.
  
5.	Model Development
Four machine learning models were developed and evaluated:
- o	Linear Regression: A simple and interpretable model used as a baseline.
- o	Random Forest Regressor: A tree-based ensemble model that captures non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.
- o	Gradient Boosting Regressor: Builds additive models iteratively and excels in predictive accuracy.
- o	Support Vector Regressor (SVR): A powerful model for small to medium-sized datasets, ideal for handling high-dimensional regression tasks.
  
Each model was trained using the same feature set, and hyperparameters were tuned to optimize performance.

6.	Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using standard regression performance metrics:
- o	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- o	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Tree-based models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) showed superior performance due to their ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and energy output.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
To improve model performance, I applied Hyperopt with the TPE algorithm for hyperparameter tuning on two of the most promising models:
- •	Random Forest Regressor
- •	Gradient Boosting Regressor

### Pre-Tuning vs. Post-Tuning Results
- MSE was used for hyperparameter tuning 
1. Random Forest: Before tuning 
- MAE: 5.56
- MSE: 142.55
- After tuning: MSE: 27.74

2. Gradient Boosting: Before tuning 
- MAE: 5.73
- MSE: 70.05
- After tuning: MSE: 4.44

  - •	Significant Drop in MSE for both models.
  - •	Sharper predictions and better generalization on unseen data.

## Best Performing Model
The Gradient Boosting Regressor emerged as the best-performing model after tuning:
- •	Achieved a significantly lower MSE of 4.44 (down from 70.05 pre-tuning).
- •	While the Random Forest Regressor also showed improvement, its post-tuning MSE of 27.74 was still higher than the Gradient Boosting model.

## Why MSE Was Used for Hyperparameter Tuning
- •	MSE (Mean Squared Error) was used as the optimization objective because:
  - o	It penalizes larger errors more aggressively than MAE, making it ideal when big mistakes are costly.
  - o	It offers smoother gradients, which work perfectly with Hyperopt's TPE algorithm for tuning.
  - o	MAE was used after tuning for model evaluation to check robustness and interpretability.
    
## Computational Implications
Hyperparameter tuning was compute-heavy but provided significant improvements in model accuracy:
- •	Random Forest Trials: 4510+ iterations in 9+ hours.
- •	Gradient Boosting Trials: 16,359+ iterations in 31+ hours.
  
The trade-off was massively reduced error and higher prediction reliability.
